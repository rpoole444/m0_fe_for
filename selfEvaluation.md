# Self Evaluation

- How confident do you feel in your understanding and fluency with the `for` statement?
There are so many twists and turns and not a lot of models to follow.  I am terrible at finding coding examples online that fit the situations in this training. I definitely need more experience with this.


- This was a much more advanced concept than anything you've done in Mod 0, and the exercises required you to push yourself to apply other background knowledge or learn things outside of the curriculum - how did that feel? Did you have productive struggle? Unproductive struggle?

It was not a great feeling today as My son kept me up from 3am till 5am last night. My day started out pretty great, I was working through things steadily and easily, then as the tasks became more challenging, and when the material was no longer easily accessed, and I had to find my own resources, is when my mind and body began show signs of fatigue, which then turned into frustration. I was proud to stay on course with a generally productive struggle all morning and afternoon, but after enough failed attempts and confusion I began a downward slope of unproductive struggle. I don't want to fall into this again.

- What do you still need to practice or learn? How will you do that? Do you need to adjust your calendar in order to do that?

I Need to practice with  "for" statements and also how to use the various different code's within, including those in the 'if' and "Console"

- What questions do you still have? How will you get the answers you need?

I'm just glad to have worked with you to get through these questions. I had failed so many times and had no luck with my own attempts. I will be more patient in the future, and I really need to find some helpful resources, rightnow i feel like I was misunderstanding and/or over complicating the resources, while trying to complete this assignment.
